# ml-model-tanami

This repository contains datasets, machine learning models, and resources for the Tanami App, focused on crop recommendations and soil classification.

## ðŸš€ What We Do

- **Data Collection**: Gathering datasets for crop recommendations and soil classification from various sources like Google, Kaggle, and Roboflow.
- **Model Creation**: 
  - Developed a **Crop Recommendation** model using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**.
  - Created a **Soil Classification** model using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.
- **Model Conversion**: The models are then converted to **TensorFlow.js (TFJS)** for use in web applications and **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** for mobile app deployment.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Model Conversion**: TensorFlow.js, TensorFlow Lite
- **Data Sources**: Google, Kaggle, Roboflow
- **Programming Language**: Python
